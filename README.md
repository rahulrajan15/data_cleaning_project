# Data Cleaning using SQL Server
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. 
When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled.
If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct.

# Benifits of Data Cleaning 
Business operations and decision-making are increasingly data-driven, as organizations look to use data analytics to help improve business performance and gain competitive advantages over rivals.
As a result, clean data is a must for BI and data science teams, business executives, marketing managers, sales reps and operational workers. 
That's particularly true in retail, financial services and other data-intensive industries, but it applies to organizations across the board, both large and small.
